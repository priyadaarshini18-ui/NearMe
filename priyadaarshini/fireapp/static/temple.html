                The Jalakandeswarar Temple is a historic Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Shiva, located inside Vellore Fort in Tamil Nadu. Built during the Vijayanagara Empire, the temple is renowned for its exquisite Vijayanagara-style architecture, intricate carvings, and impressive Kalyana Mandapa (wedding hall). The temple's name means "Lord of Water" and it is believed to be named for its location near a water tank.
